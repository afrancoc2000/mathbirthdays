Birthday Challenge

mathbirthdays.com is a site that wants to help people celebrate their special "math birthdays." A "math birthday" is a date that is 10^n days after the day they were born. On your first math birthday you are 10 days old, and on your second you are 100 days old, and on your third you are 1000 days old, which is almost 3 years old, etc. 

The mathbirthdays.com site is very simple. There is a form or widget for selecting your birth date, and the page shows your next upcoming math birthday. For example, if your birth date was 3 days ago, it would say "Your next math birthday is your 10-day-old birthday on X date," where X date is a week from now. If your birth date was over 2 years ago, it would say "Your next math birthday is your 1000-day-old birthday on Y date" where Y date is maybe a couple hundred days away in the future. 

The site is a single html file with no assets. All css and javascript is inline or hosted in publicly accessible locations elsewhere (like jquery or other frameworks).

For the challenge:

1. Design and implement the birth date selector that is easy and intuitive with minimal unnecessary clicks, and works on large and small screens (responsive and touch friendly). Please include any design ideas (wireframes or photos of drawings) that you considered and rejected. Please don't limit yourself to just the idea of a calendar.

2. Design and implement the javascript to calculate and display the next math birthday date message below the date selector.
Please remember, the site is a single html file with no external custom assets and with all libraries publicly accessible (like jquery etc.)

Feel free to use any libraries or frameworks for the date selector or date calculations or anything else you want.

In this challenge, you will be judged on: 
1. Cleanliness of code
2. Responsiveness of the design
3. Usability and aesthetics of the design
